## 3. Detailed Findings

### 1. Absence of Anti-CSRF Tokens

- **Severity:** Medium 
- **Description:**  
  No CSRF tokens were detected in forms or headers. This could allow attackers to perform actions on behalf of an authenticated user.

- **Affected URLs:**  
  - https://ihealth.iium.edu.my

- **Business Impact:**  
  Could lead to unauthorized actions such as changing passwords or making transactions.

- **OWASP Reference:**  
  - [OWASP A01 - Broken Access Control](https://owasp.org/Top10/A01_2021-Broken_Access_Control)  
  
- **Recommendation:**  
  Implement CSRF tokens for all state-changing requests.

- **Prevention Strategy:**  
  - Use frameworks with built-in CSRF protection
  - Validate tokens server-side

### 2. Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set

- **Severity:** Medium 
- **Description:**  
  No CSP header is set to restrict where resources can be loaded from.

- **Affected URLs:**  
  -  https://ihealth.iium.edu.my

- **Business Impact:**  
  Increases risk of XSS and data injection attacks.

- **OWASP Reference:**  
  - [OWASP A05 - Security Misconfiguration](https://owasp.org/Top10/A05_2021-Security_Misconfiguration/)

- **Recommendation:**  
  Set a strict CSP header to control allowed sources.

- **Prevention Strategy:**  
  - Define a strong CSP
  - Regularly audit headers and script sources

> **Responsible Team:** DevOps Team    
> **Target Remediation Date:** 2025-06-15

### 3. Vulnerable JS Library (Bootstrap v3.3.0)

- **Severity:** Medium 
- **Description:**  
  The version in use has known vulnerabilities (e.g., CVE-2018-14041, CVE-2019-8331).

- **Affected URLs:**  
  -  /public/js/plugins/bootstrap/bootstrap.min.js

- **Business Impact:**  
  May lead to XSS or client-side logic bypass.

- **OWASP Reference:**  
  - [OWASP A06 - Using Vulnerable Components](https://owasp.org/Top10/A06_2021-Vulnerable_and_Outdated_Components/)

- **Recommendation:**  
  Upgrade to the latest Bootstrap version.

- **Prevention Strategy:**  
  - Monitor NVD (National Vulnerability Database)
  - Use dependency management tools

> **Responsible Team:** Frontend Team    
> **Target Remediation Date:** 2025-06-15

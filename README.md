## 3. Detailed Findings

### Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set

- **Severity:** Medium 
- **Description:**  
  The server does not set a Content Security Policy (CSP) header. This increases the risk of XSS attacks.

- **Affected URLs:**  
  - https://ihealth.iium.edu.my(#)

- **Business Impact:**  
  May allow attackers to inject malicious scripts, leading to session hijacking or data theft.

- **OWASP Reference:**  
  (https://owasp.org/Top10/A05_2021-Security_Misconfiguration/)(#)

- **Recommendation:**  
  [Suggested fix, e.g., "Validate user inputs using allow-lists."]

- **Prevention Strategy:**  
  - Enforce input validation.
  - Use secure HTTP headers.
  - Apply regular code reviews and testing.

> **Responsible Team:** [e.g., DevOps]  
> **Target Remediation Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]
